Introduction:
 
   We aim to create an interactive webpage that displays the qualities and stats about different models of the same car. 
We will make a timeline, using a picture of the current model of the car we are presenting as the slider. The picture will change to show a newer model once it reaches the year the newer model launched, the rest of the stats with update automatically. We will present the car's stats such as fuel usage and speed in a horizontal bar graph. We will include information about the car's engine and other information in boxes above the time line. On the left side of the webpage we will have 5 buttons allowing the users to choose between 5 brand of cars, each having 4 models. We might consider making the timeline move automatically at a speed proportional to the car's speed. Other details will be considered once the basic components of the website is complete.
